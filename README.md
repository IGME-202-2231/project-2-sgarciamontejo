# Project _NAME_

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

_REPLACE OR REMOVE EVERYTING BETWEEN "\_"_

### Student Info

-   Name: _Sebastian Garcia Montejo_
-   Section: _04_

## Simulation Design

_Bees wandering around the scene looking for pollen. Player can interact with the scene by placing flowers and bears, which will change the behavior of the bees.
They will be attracted to the flowers, and will run away from the bear. The bear will attack the hives of the bees, and if he is successful in destroying the hive, all the bees on screen will attack the bear._

### Controls

-   _List all of the actions the player can have in your simulation_
    -   _Include how to preform each action ( keyboard, mouse, UI Input )_
    -   _Include what impact an action has in the simulation ( if is could be unclear )_

## _Agent 1 Name_

_A brief explanation of this agent._

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
   - _If behavior has input data list it here_
   - _eg, Flee - nearest Agent2_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   - _eg, When this agent gets within range of Agent2_
   - _eg, When this agent has reached target of State2_
   
### _State 2 Name_

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_

## Make it Your Own

- _Player will be able to left click to add flowers, and right click to add bears. Both of which will change the behavior of the bees._

## Known Issues

_List any errors, lack of error checking, or specific information that I need to know to run your program_

### Requirements not completed
